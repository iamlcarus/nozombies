# No Zombies Mod for Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead

A mod that removes *all* vanilla zombies from the game.
The mod is made by lcarus and has been updated by me, Countern, to remove all the new zombies added since the last mod update.

Updated to experimental build: 2021-10-15-0659
The mod should work if the experimental version has not added any new zombies since experimental build 2021-10-06-1602.
